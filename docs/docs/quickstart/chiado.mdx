# Run a Validator or a Full Node on Chiado

Validators and Full Nodes protect the network by validating transactions and blocks. They are the backbone of the
network and are responsible for the security of the network. This guide shows you how to use Sedge to set up a full node or a validator on Chiado, a Gnosis testnet.

:::info

 Validating the Gnosis Beacon Chain requires 1
[GNO](https://docs.gnosischain.com/about/tokens/gno) per validator process.

:::

## Running a Full Node

For running a full node (without a validator node) with random clients, you only need to add the `--no-validator` to `sedge cli`. For example:

```bash
sedge cli --no-validator --network=chiado
```

## Running a Validator

For running a validator with random clients, you need to omit the `--no-validator` flag. For example:

```bash
sedge cli --network=chiado
```

## Create keystore for validator

To create a keystore for a validator, you need to run the following command:

```bash
sedge keys --network chiado
```

## Consensus Clients Requirements

:::tip

The hardware requirements you are about to see are for Gnosis. Chiado is a lighter network, the following requirements can be considered as minimum for a full node in Chiado:
- 2 CPU cores
- 4 GB RAM
- 160 GB SDD

:::tip

We recommend using `Lighthouse` or `Teku` while using Sedge for Chiado as they are the most stable and tested clients.

:::

:::caution

Sedge supports Prysm for Chiado, but Prysm version for this network is not stable. Use it at your own risk. We do not recommend to use Prysm for Chiado.
